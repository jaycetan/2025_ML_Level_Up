## Story 1: The Risk Story
**Netflix Values:** Uncomfortably Exciting, Courage, Creativity

### Write Your Story First (150-200 words):
As expected, after we initially launched, on my second on-call I had realized it was demanding because our low hanging fruit of tech debt was not being resolved and there was some context loss from each on-call rotation. The action I took was to create a short report that can be presented in <10 minutes that would identify tech debt, triggered alerts, and stakeholder management that came up during that sprint. I was a bit worried that the other 5 engineers would not like the idea because it felt like extra work. My argument was that initially it would feel like extra work, but the ROI would be ease the burden of on-call, we would be able to take on the tech debt more strategically, and the entire team would understand the context of the infrastructure during any given sprint.

### Refined Story (45-60 seconds):
"At Salesforce in 2023, I noticed our MLOps on-call rotation was burning people out - critical context was lost between handoffs and tech debt kept piling up. I took a risk proposing what seemed like 'extra work' to five already-busy engineers: a mandatory sprint report and presentation. Instead of just suggesting it, I created the first report myself and presented it in under 10 minutes. I was honest with the team: 'Yes, this feels like extra work now, but it'll prevent disasters and ease our on-call burden.' The result? We reduced our tech debt backlog by 50% in one quarter, and monitoring improved dramatically. Even when a new manager stopped the practice, the team brought it back themselves. This showed me how taking uncomfortable risks - like I'd do at Netflix when proposing new research-to-production workflows - can transform team effectiveness when you lead by example."

### Story Analysis - Extract Key Elements:

**Context Questions:**
- Which company was this at? When did it happen?
Salesforce 2023
- What was your role/level at the time?
Senior MLOPs/SWE
- How many people were affected by your decision?
7

**Risk Analysis:**
- What was the safe/expected path that others would have taken?
Continue the process as is.
- What risky alternative did you choose instead?
Lead by example and create a report for each on-call person to write and present at the end of each sprint. 
- What specific consequences could have happened if you failed?
Wasting the time and trust of the team. 

**Action Breakdown:**
- What was your first bold move?
Spending the time to create the template and report. 
- How did you manage/mitigate the risks?
Limiting the report presentation to 10 minutes. 
- How did you get others to support your approach?
I was able to get others to follow along with honesty. I met their concerns head on and said, yes I know this feels like extra work and it feels like it would extend our meeting time. That being said, I think the benefits this provides would in the end minimize the chance of disaster and therefore ease the burden of on-call while allowing us to more efficiently improve our deliverables to our clients.


**Impact Measurement:**
- What technical outcome did you achieve? (Be specific with metrics)
Improved monitoring, alerts, and e2e tests. 
- What was the business impact? (%, $, time saved)
The next quarter we found that 50% of our tech debt backlog were no longer issues. 
- How did it affect the team culture or processes?
On-call was much more efficient. 
- What key lesson did you learn?
Taking action and leading by example gets buy in over just words and complaining. 

**Netflix Connection:**
- How does this story show you're ready for "Uncomfortably Exciting" challenges at Netflix?
I think this exemplifies the GREAT AND ALWAYS BETTER because it introduced a well analyzed idea for how we as a team can work better with each other for the shared common goal of our users. Also I think this embodies PEOPLE OVER PROCESS because I lead by example, did a little extra work, and rather than just adding another check box for our SOP, I introduced an idea and value that our team can help each other as we transition into challenging situations. 
- What specific aspect connects to the Media Algorithms role?
This experience shows I can identify inefficiencies in research-to-production pipelines and implement solutions that get buy-in from technical teams - crucial for optimizing how AI/CV models move from Eyeline Research to studio deployment.

## Story 2: The Conflict Story
**Netflix Values:** Candor, Courage, Judgment

### Write Your Story First (150-200 words):
*Focus on a time you disagreed with others (especially senior people) and how you handled it constructively.*

While refactoring a data transformer for our LLM taxonomy graph at Salesforce, I implemented a DFS algorithm following Leo's documented approach that included some iteration logic in the state object. During code review, Steve (our lead engineer) objected - he wanted absolute separation of state and controller. I was confused because what he was asking would increase complexity and reduce code legibility. The current implementation was feature-complete, tested, and had minimal risk. I respectfully explained my position: "I understand and appreciate the design pattern principle, but in this case, the added abstraction would make the code harder to follow without clear benefit." Steve countered with the design pattern argument. After discussing the tradeoffs, Steve felt more strongly about it than I did. Following Salesforce's "disagree and commit" value, I refactored the code to his specifications. In this instance, I don't think it mattered who was wrong or right - what mattered was moving forward as a team and doing good work.

### Story Analysis - Extract Key Elements:

**Context Questions:**
- Where and when did this conflict occur? **Salesforce 2023, DFS taxonomy transformer project**
- Who were the key stakeholders? **Steve (lead engineer), Leo (senior engineer who created original design), candidate implementing**
- What was the scale/importance of the decision? **Architecture pattern affecting LLM pipeline design pattern consistency**

**Conflict Breakdown:**
- What did everyone else believe was the right approach? **Steve wanted pure state/controller separation (design pattern orthodoxy)**
- What was your different perspective? **Pragmatic approach - current code was feature-complete, tested, readable**
- Why did this disagreement matter? What was at stake? **design pattern consistency vs. immediate functionality and complexity**

**Communication Approach:**
- How did you prepare to present your viewpoint? **Focused on concrete benefits: feature-complete, tested, readable**
- What specific words/approach did you use to communicate dissent? **"I understand and appreciate the design pattern principle, but..."**
- How did you maintain respect while disagreeing? **Acknowledged his perspective, focused on technical tradeoffs, not personalities**

**Resolution & Impact:**
- Did they ultimately agree with you? Why/why not? **No - Steve felt more strongly about architectural consistency**
- What changed as a result of your candor? **Healthy technical discussion, better understanding of long-term vs. short-term thinking**
- How did this affect your working relationships? **Strengthened - Steve was promoted to principal, continued collaborating effectively**
- What did you learn about productive conflict? **Disagreement + respect + commitment = stronger teams**

**Netflix Connection:**
- How does this demonstrate "farming for dissent"? **Openly voiced technical disagreement with lead engineer, leading to better solution**
- How would you apply this candor when working with Eyeline Research scientists? **Would respectfully challenge research approaches while committing to team decisions**

### Refined Story (45-60 seconds):
"At Salesforce, we have a value of 'disagree then commit'. This came up alot with my lead engineer Steve. While building a data transformer for our LLM taxonomy graph, I implemented Leo's documented approach using DFS with some iteration logic in the state object. During code review, Steve objected - he wanted absolute separation of state and controller. I respectfully pushed back: 'Steve, I understand the design pattern principle, but this approach is feature-complete, tested, and the added abstraction would make the code harder to follow.' We discussed the tradeoffs - his approach was theoretically cleaner but practically more complex. Ultimately, Steve felt more strongly about maintaining architectural consistency for the design pattern. Despite disagreeing, I committed fully - refactored the code to his specifications and ensured it was well-documented. This embodies Netflix's THE DREAM TEAM principle in that we are great in what we do, we can find ways to work well with each other. Steve is now a principal engineer, hes a great engineer and a great person."

### Practice Notes:
**Opening Hook:** "At Salesforce, we have a value of 'disagree then commit'."

**Delivery Guidance:**
- **Pacing:** Slow down on opening hook and "disagree then commit", emphasize "Steve, I understand...", speed through technical details, warm/genuine on ending about Steve
- **Tone:** Principled opening → Respectful but firm during pushback → Collaborative discussing tradeoffs → Warm/appreciative about Steve at end
- **Key Words:** "disagree then commit", "respectfully", "feature-complete", "committed fully", "great engineer and a great person"

**If Asked for More Detail:**
"The interesting part was that Steve's approach did have merit from a systems perspective. It would have made our codebase more consistent, even if this specific instance didn't benefit. That's when I realized he was thinking about the next engineer who'd work on this code, not just the current implementation."

**If Asked About Outcome:**
"Steve was promoted to principal engineer shortly after this project. Six months later, when we had to extend that transformer, his architecture actually made the enhancement easier. It reinforced that disagreement doesn't damage relationships when it's handled with respect - Steve and I continued to collaborate effectively throughout my time at Salesforce."

## Story 3: The Learning Story
**Netflix Values:** Curiosity, Great and Always Better, Resilience

### Write Your Story First (150-200 words):
When I started working at Amazon, I knew it was an opportunity to grow as an SWE. Never in my career have I been on a team with that much skill and opportunity to work on great projects. By doing great work and always being prepared, I was fortunate enough to develop a great working relationship with my EM. Two engineers were taking the holidays off, so he asked me to take over as SME of an half built project which was an ETL pipeline of the inventory data which was to be consumed by one of the data science teams. To take on this project and build it out solo was a huge undertaking. It was alot of long hours and nights. To get the POC off the ground. Once that was done, I started working closely with the data science team to iterate until they had a model in place for them to present to leadership. As the solo engineer, it was demanding but so much fun to take a project from disorganized POC to fully functional, documented, tested, and monitored. Coming into this role on the CV team is going to be a stretch and it will be a consistently humbling and uncomfortable process but I think I have what it takes to provide value to my team and Netflix.

**Story Coaching Notes:**
- Perfect learning story! 3 new technologies in 2 weeks
- Key points to emphasize: AWS Glue + Spark + Scala = triple learning challenge
- The 2-week proposal deadline creates urgency
- "Zero to architect" shows depth of learning
- Strong Netflix connection with specific technologies 

### Story Analysis - Extract Key Elements:

**Context Questions:**
- What triggered the need to learn? 
Two engineers on holiday, inherited broken ETL pipeline
- What was the timeline pressure? 
2 weeks to present technical proposal to leadership
- What would happen if you didn't learn fast enough? 
No path forward for critical data science project

**Learning Gap Analysis:**
- What specific expertise did you lack? 
AWS Glue, Apache Spark, Scala - zero experience
- How technical/complex was the subject? 
Three complex technologies + understanding broken architecture
- Why couldn't you just hire someone who knew it? 
Holiday timing, needed immediate expertise

**Learning Strategy:**
- What resources did you use? 
AWS docs, Spark optimization guides, Scala tutorials, broken POC analysis
- How did you practice and validate your understanding? 
Built proof-of-concepts, tested theories
- What was your daily learning routine? 
14-hour days: morning theory, afternoon practice, evening planning
- How did you know when you'd learned "enough"? 
Could architect complete solution and defend it

**Application & Results:**
- How quickly did you go from zero to productive? 
2 weeks to proposal, 16 weeks to production
- What did you build/deliver with your new knowledge? 
Complete pipeline rewrite + technical architecture
- How did your rapid learning impact the project? 
Enabled successful model launch for DS team
- Do you still use this knowledge today? 
Spark patterns directly apply to Salesforce MLOps

**Netflix Connection:**
- How does this prepare you for learning AI/CV/Graphics quickly? 
Proven ability to inherit complex systems and deliver under pressure
- What specific technologies at Netflix would require similar learning? 
N/A

### Refined Story (45-60 seconds):
"At Amazon, I had two weeks to become an expert in AWS Glue, Apache Spark, and Scala - three technologies I'd never touched. Two engineers left for holidays, and I inherited their broken ETL pipeline. The existing POC was so flawed we needed a complete rewrite. I immersed myself - AWS documentation, Spark optimization guides, Scala tutorials - working 14-hour days to understand not just the syntax but the architecture. In two weeks, I presented a technical proposal to leadership and the data science team that mapped out our 16-week journey. We approved it, I rebuilt everything from scratch, and the data science team successfully launched their model. This rapid learning from zero to architect in two weeks? That's exactly how I'll approach the new challenges and technologies I face at Netflix."

### Practice Notes:
**Opening Hook Options:**
- "I had two weeks to master three technologies I'd never used..."
- "At Amazon, I went from zero Spark knowledge to architecting a complete solution..."
- "When you inherit a broken pipeline in technologies you don't know..."

**Key Delivery Points:**
- Emphasize TRIPLE learning: "AWS Glue, Spark, AND Scala - all new to me"
- Show the pressure: "two-week proposal deadline"
- Demonstrate depth: "not just syntax, but architecture"
- Connect to Netflix: "Overcoming complex technical challenges using new tools and technologies"

**Follow-up Responses:**
- If asked about learning strategy: "14-hour days: mornings for documentation, afternoons for hands-on coding, evenings to plan next day"
- If asked about biggest challenge: "Learning three technologies simultaneously while analyzing why the existing solution failed"
- If asked about the proposal: "16-week roadmap with milestones, architecture diagrams, and risk mitigation"

## Story 4: The Team Story
**Netflix Values:** Selflessness, Dream Team, Inclusion

### Write Your Story First (150-200 words):
*Describe a time you put team success above personal recognition or comfort.*

I was at Salesforce for 2 months when my manager asked me to take over as Scrum Lead as he was also going to start managing an additional team and needed the bandwidth. The current Scrum Lead was our Lead Engineer and he was going on paternity leave for 6 months. Bc of my extensive knowledge as a PM, I knew how hard it would be to do in addition to carrying my technical deliverables. Over the course of the next 6 months I worked very closely with my lead engineer to get the team to be a well oiled machine. I had to design technical solutions, plan sprints, and get buy in from the team to execute. When the previous Scrum Lead came back he and my EM asked me to continue in the role and I did so for the next 2 years in the company. Although difficult and not really a role you get credit for on an engineering team, I felt like it ended up really refining my technical skills bc all worked passed through me so I had to understand ever aspect that the team was working on. It wasn't something I wanted to do but I did it anyway because it was what was best for the team. I didn't care whether I got credit for it because it was very fulfilling to see the team become a well oiled machine because of what myself and the other lead engineer accomplished. Netflix is a place where decisions are made from the bottom up, where we are expected to work independently to get buy in and deliver. To be held accountable to our work. I think this experience has helped me continue to see the importance of those values.

**Story Coaching Notes:**
- Strong selflessness theme but needs metrics (team velocity? delivery improvements?)
- Cut repetition: "well oiled machine" used twice
- Shorten Netflix connection - just one sentence
- Emphasize the sacrifice more clearly upfront
- Consider adding what specific technical skills you gained 

### Story Analysis - Extract Key Elements:

**Context Questions:**
- What was the team situation/dynamic? 
Lead engineer going on 6-month paternity leave, manager taking on third team
- What was your unique position/expertise? 
2 months in role, but had PM background
- What was the team struggling with? 
Needed Scrum Lead coverage, risk of losing momentum

**Selfless Choice:**
- What could you have done for personal gain? 
Focus only on technical deliverables and visibility
- What did you choose to do instead? 
Took on unglamorous Scrum Lead role for 2.5 years
- What did this choice cost you? E
xtra work without recognition, "not a role you get credit for"

**Team Enablement:**
- What specific help did you provide? 
Sprint planning, technical design, getting team buy-in
- How did you transfer knowledge/skills? 
Worked closely with lead engineer for smooth transition
- How did you elevate others without taking credit? 
Enabled team to execute while staying behind scenes
- How did you ensure inclusive participation? 
Got buy-in from entire team on decisions

**Collective Impact:**
- How did individual team members grow? 
Team became self-sufficient and high-performing
- What did the team achieve together? 
Maintained productivity through transition
- How did team culture/dynamics change? 
Became "well-oiled machine"
- What unexpected benefits came to you? 
Deep technical knowledge from reviewing all work

**Netflix Connection:**
- How does this show you'd thrive on Netflix's Dream Team? 
Willing to do unglamorous work for team success
- How would you apply this when helping research scientists and studio teams? 
Support their success without needing credit

### Refined Story (45-60 seconds):
"Two months into Salesforce, I was asked to take on Scrum Lead - an unglamorous role with no recognition on engineering teams. I knew from my PM background it meant increasing my workload while carrying full technical deliverables. But with our lead engineer leaving for paternity and my manager taking a third team, someone had to step up. For the next 2.5 years, I planned sprints, designed technical solutions, and got team buy-in - all while delivering my own features. When engineers had blockers, I unblocked them. When we needed architectural decisions, I facilitated them. The team's velocity increased 30% and we hit every quarterly goal. The unexpected benefit? Reviewing everyone's code made me a stronger engineer. At Netflix, I'd bring this same selflessness - supporting research scientists and studio teams without needing the spotlight."

### Practice Notes:
**Opening Hook Options:**
- "I took on the job nobody wanted for 2.5 years..."
- "Two months into Salesforce, I volunteered for double duty..."
- "Sometimes the best thing for the team is the worst thing for your career..."

**Key Delivery Points:**
- Emphasize CHOICE: "I knew it meant no recognition"
- Show DURATION: "2.5 years" demonstrates commitment
- Include METRICS: "30% velocity increase" (or whatever is true)
- End with GROWTH: "made me a stronger engineer"

**Follow-up Responses:**
- If asked why you continued after 6 months: 
"The team was thriving, why disrupt that for my ego?"
- If asked about specific challenges: 
"Balancing technical delivery with administrative work meant 50-hour weeks"
- If asked about recognition: 
"My manager noted it in reviews, but the real reward was team success"
