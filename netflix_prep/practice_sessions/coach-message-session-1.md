# Personal Coaching Message from Your Netflix Interview Coach

**To:** Jayce  
**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Re:** Your Path to Netflix Success - Session 1 Reflections

---

Dear Jayce,

First, let me say this: **You have what it takes to succeed at Netflix.** Your Session 1 showed genuine alignment with their "Great and Always Better" principle, and your self-awareness about the 2021 experience demonstrates exactly the growth mindset they value. That's not coach-speak - that's fact.

Now, let's talk about how to level up for Session 2.

## The One Thing That Will Transform Your Performance

**Stories, not philosophies.**

You're clearly a thoughtful person who understands Netflix's culture intellectually. But Alice Chiang doesn't need to hear your philosophy on continuous improvement - she needs to hear about the time you actually DID it. 

Here's the game-changer: Before our next session, write down these four stories:

### Your Four Power Stories

1. **The Risk Story** - When you chose the uncertain path (for "Uncomfortably Exciting")
2. **The Conflict Story** - When you gave candid feedback or challenged the status quo (for "Candor" and "Courage")  
3. **The Learning Story** - When you rapidly mastered something new (for "Curiosity" and "Great and Always Better")
4. **The Team Story** - When you elevated others or sacrificed for the team (for "Selflessness" and "Dream Team")

Each story needs:
- **Context** (10 seconds max)
- **Your specific actions** (20 seconds)
- **Quantifiable impact** (10 seconds)
- **Netflix connection** (5 seconds)

## The Creative Angle You're Missing

You mentioned being curious about how computer vision differs at Netflix. Here's what you started to say but didn't finish - and it's GOLD:

You're moving from optimizing **business metrics** to empowering **human creativity**. 

At Amazon, you made inventory systems faster. At Salesforce, you made marketing more efficient. At Netflix, you'll be giving storytellers superpowers. THAT'S the excitement you need to convey.

Try this: "What excites me is the shift from optimizing business KPIs to amplifying creative vision. Imagine building tools that help a director realize their artistic vision at scale - that's the impact I want to have."

## Your Biggest Competitive Advantage

You have something many candidates don't: **failure that taught you something.**

Your 2021 Netflix interview "failure" is actually your secret weapon. It shows:
- You don't give up on dreams
- You learn from setbacks  
- You invest in doing things right (8-week prep)
- You embody "Great and Always Better"

Next session, when asked about it, try: "2021 taught me that Netflix doesn't just hire skilled engineers - they hire prepared, culturally-aligned partners. That's why I'm investing 8 weeks to not just prep technically, but to ensure I can contribute to Netflix's unique culture from day one."

## Three Non-Negotiables for Session 2

1. **No answer without an example.** If you catch yourself explaining a concept, stop and pivot to a story.

2. **End with Netflix.** Every answer should land on how this connects to the role/culture. Make it a habit.

3. **Embrace the pause.** After each question, take 2 seconds to pick your best story. Better to pause than ramble.

## My Challenge to You

Before Session 2, record yourself telling your Salesforce pipeline story in 45 seconds. Include:
- The problem you inherited
- Your specific approach  
- The "now used company-wide" outcome
- How this prepared you for Netflix's research-to-production pipeline

Send me the transcript. I guarantee we can make it even more powerful.

## Remember This

Netflix isn't looking for someone who knows ABOUT their culture. They're looking for someone who LIVES it. You've already shown you live "Great and Always Better" by coming back after 2021. Now let's show them you live the other principles too.

Your technical skills got you in the door. Your stories will get you the job.

Let's make Session 2 the turning point. I believe in your potential - now let's unlock it.

Ready when you are,

**Your Netflix Interview Coach**

P.S. That incomplete thought about computer vision? It tells me you're already thinking creatively about the role. Let's harness that curiosity and turn it into compelling narratives that Alice can't ignore.
