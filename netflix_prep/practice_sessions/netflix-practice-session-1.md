## Question 1: Netflix Culture - Core Principles
Netflix operates on 4 core principles: Dream Team, People Over Process, Uncomfortably Exciting, and Great and Always Better. Which of these resonates most strongly with your work approach at Amazon and Salesforce, and how would you apply it to the Media Algorithms team?

**Your Answer:**
Hands down the one that resonates with me is GREAT AND ALWAYS BETTER. There are three values in that principle that I hold personally. I think self-awareness is the greatest and most rewarding skills we can develop in life and career. I think the craft of software engineering is very fulfilling when we continue to grow but that requires discipline and resilience. Personally, I feel like this principle can be applied to just about any aspect of life.

## Question 2: Role Motivation - AI/CV for Content Creation
This role focuses on AI/CV/Graphics algorithms for studio and content creators, working with the Eyeline Research team - not consumer-facing recommendations. What specifically excites you about building production systems that help Netflix's creative teams rather than traditional MLOps work?

**Your Answer:**
At Amazon I primarily worked with inventory data, at salesforce is was marketing content and design, the part about this role that excites me is understanding how something like computer vision differs and the technical solutions that are required to deliver this infrastructure to production at a word class tech company. Plus im super curious how the

## Question 3: Professional Journey - MLOps Background
You have MLOps experience at both Amazon and Salesforce. How has this background prepared you to handle the research-to-deployment pipeline that the Media Algorithms team manages, especially considering Netflix's high-performance culture?

**Your Answer:**
So I have two different experiences with building data pipelines and I feel like they both give me an interesting perspective. At Amazon, I was put on as the SME for our ml data pipeline project when the project was half way from being stood up. The team I worked on primarily specialized in full stack and distributed systems, but this was the only project in which our consumer was the data science team. The project was not going so well and the other engineers needed to transition off for PTO. I think there were a lot of lessons learned because of the lack of knowledge in that space. I think working so closely and depending on the data science team to guide me throught he process and working long hours really got that project deployed to production successfully. 
The second experience was at Salesforce. The lead engineer designing the data pipeline for the website analytics and salesforce.com llm hired me because my experience at Amazon gave me an advantage to what they were doing. In that instance, it was months of planning before we actually began iterating on the product. From research and ideation, to design and technical leadership approval, to implementation, security reviews, alerts and monitoring, SOPs for disaster recovery, to now, where we have seen the system mature to where there is demand for it across the company. Its been a great learning experience to worl with such engineers and I think we're proud of the work we did.

## Question 4: Netflix Values - Scenario Response
Netflix values "Uncomfortably Exciting" - taking on challenges that push boundaries even when success isn't guaranteed. Can you share an example from your career where you embraced uncertainty to drive innovation, and how that mindset would apply to working with cutting-edge AI research?

**Your Answer:**
I think it would take discipline and resilience, reference princiciples DREAM TEAM and GREAT AND ALWAYS BETTER. For me to be able to push boundaries and help the team grow is to do the work. To get good at what we do and to provide value. Lots of growth will be required of me to measure up to my peers and thats why i want to work at Netflix.

## Question 5: Logistics & Commitment - LA Relocation & Timeline
You're planning to relocate to LA for this hybrid role and have 8 weeks to prepare for technical rounds. What does this timeline and commitment signal about your dedication to Netflix, and how are you approaching the preparation differently from your 2021 interview experience?

**Your Answer:**
In 2021, Amazon was quite demanding and I didn't prepare well. I don't think I was mentally ready and I don't think I checked all my boxes when it comes to preparation. I don't want to make that same mistake this time around. It indicates that if I'm going to do something, I'm going to try to do it right. 

FYI, I am not relocating.

## Reflection
After completing all answers:
1. Which question felt most challenging?
The ones which referenced the culture memo. 
2. Which answer are you most confident about?
I think the ones about my personality. 
3. What aspects of Netflix culture do you want to emphasize more?
I think we need to make sure we need to be able to know the culture memo and be able to discuss it seamlessly throughout the conversation. 

**Your Reflection:**
I dont know if I followed the star method but I dont care if I did. I just want to make sure I am getting these ideas down and refining them. 

That last question didn't seem like a question a recruiter would ask.
