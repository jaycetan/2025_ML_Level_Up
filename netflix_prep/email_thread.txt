Hi Jayce,
I hope you're doing well! I saw that you previously interviewed with Netflix back in 2021, reaching out to see if now is a
good time to reconnect? I'm currently hiring a Software Engineer on our Media Algorithms team. You will work closely
with scientists at the Eyeline Research Team to develop cutting-edge AI/CV/graphics algorithms that will be used by
studio/content creators. We are looking for MLOps experience and having GPU or CUDA experience would be a big plus!
Even if you're not interested in exploring new roles right now, happy to connect with you and then revisit this at
a later time ‚Äî and if you are considering something new, now is an exciting time to join us.
Read more about our unique culture.
Best,
Alice Chiang

Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out! Hope your week is off to a great start.
Netflix has always been somewhere I've wanted to work because the values allow employees to work with the most driven
engineers. This seems like a great fit, I have MLOps experience from both Amazon and Salesforce. I'm totally open to us
connecting. That being said, in 2021 I missed out on some great opportunities (Netflix included) by not taking the time to
properly prepare for interviews. It would be ~8 weeks before I feel like I would be ready for a technical interview. It's been
so long since I've even thought of system design, algorithm, and behavioral interviews. Would this timeframe work for this
position?
Also, can you tell me what the interview process would look like and what the onsite requirements are for this team? I've
been fortunate to work from home for over 5 years now so onsite would be an adjustment.
Thanks!

Hi Jayce,
It's great to hear from you. Ideally they'd like someone based out of LA so you can meet in person with our Eyeline team
when needed, but it's not a strict hybrid schedule.

Hi Alice,
Thanks for the details! Being based in LA is perfect. Looking forward to learn more about the specific AI/CV projects and
ensuring we're both confident it's a great mutual fit.
Just want to confirm the 8-week timeline doesn't conflict with your hiring schedule. I could actually start the initial rounds
(recruiter screen and manager chat) sooner if that works better - those conversations would help me prepare more
effectively for the technical portions.
Also, what does the TPS coding portion typically focus on?
Thanks!

Hi Jayce,
The 8 week timeline should work, as long as you can kickstart the first 2 steps that should be fine. Here is my calendar.
Please take a moment to review our culture memo and be prepared to discuss during our call.
