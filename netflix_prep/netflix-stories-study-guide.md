## Story 1: The Risk Story (45 seconds)

### Opening Hook Options:
- "I noticed our team kept fixing the same issues at 2AM..."
- "When you're getting woken up at 2AM twice a week..."
- "I saw an opportunity to eliminate 50% of our tech debt..."

### The Story:
"At Salesforce in 2023, I noticed our MLOps on-call rotation was burning people out - critical context was lost between handoffs and tech debt kept piling up. I took a risk proposing what seemed like 'extra work' to five already-busy engineers: a mandatory sprint report and presentation. Instead of just suggesting it, I created the first report myself and presented it in under 10 minutes. I was honest with the team: 'Yes, this feels like extra work now, but it'll prevent disasters and ease our on-call burden.' The result? We reduced our tech debt backlog by 50% in one quarter, and monitoring improved dramatically. Even when a new manager stopped the practice, the team brought it back themselves. This showed me how taking uncomfortable risks - like I'd do at Netflix when proposing new research-to-production workflows - can transform team effectiveness when you lead by example."

### Key Points to Remember:
- Problem: MLOps on-call burning people out, context lost
- Solution: Sprint on-call report and presentation
- Resistance: Five busy engineers saw it as extra work
- Leading by example: Created first report, presented in 10 minutes
- Results: 50% tech debt reduction in one quarter
- Team adoption: Even after manager stopped it, team brought it back
- Netflix connection: Transform research-to-production workflows

## Story 2: The Conflict Story (60 seconds)

### Opening Hook Options:
- "At Salesforce, we have a value of 'disagree and commit'..."
- "I had a technical disagreement with my lead engineer Steve..."
- "Sometimes being right isn't as important as being aligned..."

### The Story:
"At Salesforce, we have a value of 'disagree and commit'. This came up a lot with my lead engineer Steve. While building a data transformer for our LLM taxonomy graph, I implemented Leo's documented approach using DFS with some iteration logic in the state object. During code review, Steve objected - he wanted absolute separation of state and controller. I respectfully pushed back: 'Steve, I understand the design pattern principle, but this approach is feature-complete, tested, and the added abstraction would make the code harder to follow.' We discussed the tradeoffs - his approach was theoretically cleaner but practically more complex. Ultimately, Steve felt more strongly about maintaining for the design pattern. Despite disagreeing, I committed fully - refactored the code to his specifications and ensured it was well-documented. This embodies Netflix's THE DREAM TEAM principle in that we are great in what we do, we can find ways to work well with each other. Steve is now a principal engineer, he's a great engineer and a great person."

### Key Points to Remember:
- Technology: DFS algorithm for LLM taxonomy graph
- Conflict: State/controller separation debate
- My approach: Leo's pragmatic implementation
- Steve's approach: Pure design pattern adherence
- Resolution: Disagreed but committed fully
- Outcome: Steve now Principal Engineer, maintained good relationship
- Netflix connection: Dream Team collaboration

## Story 3: The Learning Story (45 seconds)

### Opening Hook Options:
- "I had two weeks to master three technologies I'd never used..."
- "At Amazon, I went from zero Spark knowledge to architecting a complete solution..."
- "Two weeks. Three technologies. Zero experience."

### The Story:
"At Amazon, I had two weeks to become an expert in AWS Glue, Apache Spark, and Scala - three technologies I'd never touched. Two engineers left for holidays, and I inherited their broken ETL pipeline. The existing POC was so flawed we needed a complete rewrite. I immersed myself - AWS documentation, Spark optimization guides, Scala tutorials - working 14-hour days to understand not just the technologies but also the project context. In two weeks, I presented a technical proposal to leadership and the data science team that mapped out our 16-week journey. We approved it, I rebuilt everything from scratch, and the data science team successfully launched their model. This rapid learning from zero to architect in two weeks? That's exactly how I'll approach the new challenges and technologies I face at Netflix."

### Key Points to Remember:
- Technologies: AWS Glue, Apache Spark, Scala
- Timeline: 2 weeks to learn and present proposal
- Challenge: Broken POC needed complete rewrite
- Method: 14-hour days - theory, practice, planning
- Deliverable: Technical proposal + 16-week roadmap
- Result: Successful model launch
- Netflix connection: Same approach for new AI/CV tools

## Story 4: The Team Story (60 seconds)

### Opening Hook Options:
- "I took on the job nobody wanted for 2.5 years..."
- "Two months into Salesforce, I volunteered for double duty..."
- "Sometimes the best thing for the team is the worst thing for your career..."

### The Story:
"Two months into Salesforce, I was asked to take on Scrum Lead - an unglamorous role with no recognition on engineering teams. I knew from my PM background it meant increasing my workload while carrying full technical deliverables. But with our lead engineer leaving for paternity and my manager taking a third team, someone had to step up. For the next 2.5 years, I planned sprints, designed technical solutions, and got team buy-in - all while delivering my own features. When engineers had blockers, I unblocked them. When we needed architectural decisions, I facilitated them. The team's velocity increased 30% and we hit every quarterly goal. The unexpected benefit? Reviewing everyone's code made me a stronger engineer. At Netflix, I'd bring this same selflessness - supporting research scientists and studio teams without needing the spotlight."

### Key Points to Remember:
- Timing: 2 months into role, continued for 2.5 years
- Sacrifice: Double workload, no recognition
- Why: Lead on paternity, manager taking third team
- Actions: Sprint planning, unblocking, facilitating decisions
- Results: 30% velocity increase, hit all quarterly goals
- Personal growth: Became stronger engineer
- Netflix connection: Support without spotlight

## Emergency Backup Phrases

If asked a question you haven't prepared for:
- "Let me share a specific example..."
- "At [Company], I faced a similar situation..."
- "That reminds me of when..."

If you need thinking time:
- "Great question. The most relevant example would be..."
- "I've encountered this several times. The best instance was..."

Remember: Stories > Philosophy. Always default to concrete examples.
