## Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I'm a senior MLOps engineer at Salesforce managing 5TB/month LLM pipelines. What excites me about this role is bridging cutting-edge AI research with studio creators - I've built consumer apps and understand both the technical challenges of scaling ML and the creative process. When I saw how Eyeline Research is pushing boundaries in AI/CV for content creation, I knew this was where I wanted to contribute. My experience rapidly learning new technologies and building production systems would help researchers see their innovations deployed at Netflix scale."
