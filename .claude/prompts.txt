merge them into the netflix_prep/practice_sessions/four-power-stories-template.md:61~99

==========

i thought of a story where we were building a data transformer algorithm and dfs was required to traverse the taxonomy graph. steve wanted absolute separation of state and controller but because 
of the deeply nested objects leo proposed a solution where there was some iteration in the state object. it came to me to implement and i went with what leo had documented unknowingly. when steve 
we all reviewed the code, steve objected to the implementation but I was confused. What he was asking was going to increase the complexity and legibility of the code. i understand and appreciate 
the design pattern but in the current state it is feature complete and has minimal risk. in the end, he felt more strongly about it than i did so i went with his guidance. in this instance i dont 
think it matters who's wrong or right. salesforce has a value of disagree and commit. although i disagreed i committed to doing good work and owning the task at hand. use this as the example 
story. replace the current options with variations of this.


==========


i have included my resume here. only make the absolutely necessary changes to the memory bank and the docs in netflix_prep dir. 
.claude/docs/Resume_JayceTan_2025.md

based on my experience at salesforce give me three options of stories to use for netflix_prep/practice_sessions/four-power-stories-template.md:62~63 section. steve is my lead engineer. leo is the other senior. and we have 3 other engineers. steve and i have disagreed lot but i cant think of a good story.

you should always give me the feedback in a document. leave a place at the bottom for us to chat. create a template so that we can have some back and fourth. put the practice session and session summaries in their own dedicated dir. 

based on how this went feel free to update any project docs. be sure to give me a clear explanation why you felt the change was necessary after it is done.

netflix_prep/recruiter-interview-questions.md

dont forget to update memory bank. 

============

put a prompt in .claude/prompts that will instruct an agent to create the daily files. 

use the .claude/generalized_prompt_engineering_guide.md for a guide on how to create a prompt. 




==========

it would benefit us to find examples for our learning framework and content to fille it with. give me a prompt to have an agent help us find github repos as examples of how to structure our learning framework and scrapte of knowledge content like questions and answers. the deliverable should be a length of github repos you can review. 


=========

can we merge these files? does it make sense to have both? how do these file benefit our process?

/Users/jayce.tan/Code/JT/2025_ML_Level_Up/CLAUDE.md


can we move memory-bank to the .claude dir and update the to account for this?

=========

1 i would like the agent to create a directory for the underlying day. there should individual files for 1 blind 75 
question, one machine learning system design question, two behavioral questions, and one machine learning interview question

2 c this is a great idea. at the end of each day, the agent will report my perofrmance and track over time. i will be graded 1-5 based on my responses. i would like to track these metrics over time. 

3 we will be tracking answers and performance as previously discussed. 

4 c

5 a. it should ensure i am using python at an expert level

=======

the puroose of this project is to help me prepare to transition from swe to mlops engineer or mle. we are setting a framework so that everyday an agent will quiz me on 1 blind 75 
  question, one machine learning system design question, two behavioral questions, and one machine learning interview question. \

  Iteratively ask minimal clarifying questions (yes/no or multiple-choice format) to clarify ambiguity before proceeding. Provide recommendations where helpful. Never make assumptions 
  without explicit approval.\
