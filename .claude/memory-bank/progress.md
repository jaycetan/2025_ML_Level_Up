## Metrics to Track

- **Coverage:** Questions completed per category
- **Performance:** Average scores by category and topic
- **Consistency:** Daily practice streak
- **Improvement:** Score trends over time
- **Time Efficiency:** Average time per question type

## Notes

- User emphasized Python expertise as critical for MLOps/MLE transition
- System should feel like daily interview practice
- Grading should be honest self-assessment (1-5 scale)
- Focus on building confidence through consistent practice
