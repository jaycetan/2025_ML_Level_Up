# Interview Preparation Guide

## Grading System

- **5**: Excellent - Optimal solution, clear explanation, handles edge cases
- **4**: Good - Working solution, minor improvements possible
- **3**: Satisfactory - Basic solution works, some issues
- **2**: Needs Improvement - Partial solution or significant gaps
- **1**: Insufficient - Major issues or incomplete

## Question Categories

### Blind 75
- Focus on Python-specific optimizations
- Include time/space complexity analysis
- Multiple solution approaches (brute force â†’ optimal)

### ML System Design
- Mix of general ML systems and MLOps-specific scenarios
- Covers: data pipelines, model serving, monitoring, A/B testing

### Behavioral
- STAR format responses
- Focus on leadership, conflict resolution, technical decision-making

### ML Interview
- Theoretical concepts and practical implementation
- Topics: algorithms, statistics, deep learning, MLOps practices

## Daily Workflow

1. Agent creates directory for current date
2. Generates questions based on performance history
3. User completes each question
4. Agent grades responses (1-5)
5. Scores are logged for tracking
6. End-of-day performance summary generated

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Question Selection**: Questions are selected based on past performance (graded 1-5)
- **Daily Structure**: Each day gets its own directory with individual files for each question type
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks scores over time with analytics and visualizations
- **Python Focus**: All solutions and systems are implemented in Python to ensure expert-level proficiency
