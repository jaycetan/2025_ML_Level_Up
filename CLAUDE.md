# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Mandatory Agent Rules

**IMPORTANT**: These rules MUST be followed throughout the ENTIRE conversation.

### 1. **CLARIFY FIRST**
Iteratively ask minimal clarifying questions (yes/no or multiple-choice format) before proceeding. Never make assumptions without explicit approval.

### 2. **SYSTEMATIC APPROACH** 
Break down work into clear steps. Use TodoWrite tool for complex tasks. Build incrementally, validate each step.

### 3. **CONTROLLED CHANGES**
Explain how/why/what before executing. Modify only what was agreed upon. Request permission for changes beyond scope.

### 4. **RESEARCH & VERIFY**
Use context7, DuckDuckGo, and project files liberally. Reference official documentation. Verify against multiple sources.

### 5. **MEMORY MANAGEMENT**
Keep memory bank concise and current. Update after completing subtasks. Memory bank location: `.claude/memory-bank/`
